The tokenomics of $DOUG are structured as follows:

BonkeDAO receives an airdrop pre-launch, with 50% of the allocation going to the treasury of the DAO and the remaining 50% distributed to holders of staked NFTs.

**Liquidity Provision:** In exchange for the seed investment, DougAI receives 5 billion $bonk tokens to be used for liquidity of the $doug token on a BONK-DOUG pair, representing 20% of the total token supply. This allocation supports the liquidity and trading of $doug tokens on decentralized exchanges.

**Protocol Growth:** 40% of the 1 billion token supply of $doug is allocated for protocol growth initiatives. This includes funding for marketing efforts, engaging professional market makers, securing listings on centralized exchanges such as Binance, and executing other strategic actions aimed at fostering the growth and adoption of the DougAI platform.

**Research and Development:** The remaining 20% of the $doug token supply is dedicated to research and development efforts. This allocation supports ongoing innovation and enhancement of the platform, including funding for the current and future development team, as well as research initiatives aimed at advancing the capabilities of the DougAI ecosystem.
